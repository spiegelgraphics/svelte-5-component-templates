DER SPIEGEL Svelte 5 Component Templates

## Add a new component

1. Create a new branch and checkout the branch
```
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

2. Add component, stage changes, commit and push
```
git add .
git commit -m 'Add new component xy'
git push
```

3. Create a new pull request via the GitHub website and select one of your colleagues to check your addition

4. Optional: Make changes

5. The reviewer approves the pull request and the new component is available on the main branch


## Examples

Example usages of components can be found in the [examples directory](./examples/). New examples can be added without pull request.
